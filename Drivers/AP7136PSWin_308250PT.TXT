Notes and Restrictions for PS(Plug-in) drivers

- Regarding Account Track
  "password" is registered as default password.
  Please change it if necessary.

- Depending on the characteristics of images in documents, moire patterns 
  (unexpected repetitive pattern) may occur. 
  In case that moire patterns occur, using other screen settings or changing 
  resolution may reduce moire patterns.
  When moire patterns occur while printing from Microsoft Office applications 
  with transparent effect, please consider removing transparent effect, 
  otherwise apply other screen settings or change resolution may reduce moire 
  patterns.

- Insert Blank Sheet from PI Trays (Page Settings)
  It's not possible to let the printer feed papers of specified Paper Name 
  automatically from PI or PI-PFU Trays.
  Please choose a PI or PI-PFU Tray for Paper Tray instead of Auto.

- The maximum number of pages guaranteed for Per Page Settings (Forms) is as 
  follows.
   * 144 distinct page numbers when using one single form
   * 72 page ranges when using one single form
   * 42 distinct page numbers when using several different forms
   * 33 page ranges when using several different forms
  The maximum number of pages depend on each selected form and on page digits 
  set for that form.
  Therefore, the number of pages more than the above description might be 
  possible.

- Printing Text on Tab on OSX
  Text that are not supported by PS font installed in IC-604 as preset 
  are not usable for Text on Tab on OSX.
  The unsupported texts might cause garbles in the preview or prints.

- Mixed-size or mixed-orientation files
  Some applications divide mixed-size or mixed-orientation files into several 
  print jobs. In this case, functions like Perfect Binding and Cover are 
  executed for each of divided print jobs. 

- Printing from Adobe Acrobat
  1)In order to ensure that mixed-size files and files with subset fonts are 
    printed correctly, you must instruct Acrobat to generate page independent 
    code.
    1. In Acrobat's Print dialog, select Advanced. This opens the Advanced 
       Print Setup dialog.
    2. Select PostScript Options, and set Font and Resource Policy to [Send for 
       Each Page].

  2)When [Choose paper source by PDF page size] of Acrobat's Print dialog is enabled, 
    functions which result in the change of image size might make the image shrunk and rotated. 
    This can be prevented by disabling [Choose paper source by PDF page size].

- In the Chinese and Taiwanese environment on macOS Sierra, the following parts may be displayed in English.
   * Paper size
   * Printer option screen automatically displayed during and after printer registration
   * The contents of the test page

- About display resolution
  If the resolution is low, such as "800 x 600", the print setting screen may not be displayed correctly.
  In that case, change to a higher resolution before using.
  Depending on your environment, it may be resolved by changing to "1024 x 768".

- This PS Plug-in Driver supports AccurioPro Hot Folder.
